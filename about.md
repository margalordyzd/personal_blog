# Hi, I'm Jorge Espinoza

I help businesses build smart solutions using math, code and data.

I am in a constant exploration of new skills and challenges. 
My background starts with a bachelor of science degree in mechatronics engineering and my professional experience has gradually converged into the wonders of artificial intelligence and data science.
